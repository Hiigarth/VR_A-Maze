# A Maze
Starter project for the Udacity [VR Developer Nanodegree](http://udacity.com/vr) program.

- Course: VR Software Development
- Project: A Maze

# About
This project was built by Davide Dell'Aria. This project was a chance for me to combine and practice everything I learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. I had created a fully interactive VR experience in the form of a maze.  This gave me a chance to apply what I had learned with scripting to bring a full audio-visual experience together. My favorite part was doing the scripts for all the features of the game, even creating the maze was interesting, trying to do it in a fascinating way. The most difficult thing was the script of the door.

Name main scene: Main.

Other scene: There are not other scene because the game restart the main scene.

Target device: Android.
